# OTP Verification System

## Introduction
 The OTP Verification System is a Python-based application designed to enhance security through the generation and validation of one-time passwords (OTPs). This system allows users to receive a 6-digit OTP via email, ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive information.

 ## Problem Statement
In a world increasingly reliant on digital authentication, securing access to sensitive accounts is vital. Traditional methods can be easily compromised. The OTP Verification System provides an additional layer of security by ensuring that only users with access to their email can validate their identity, thus minimizing the risk of unauthorized access.

## Features
1.OTP Generation: Creates a unique 6-digit OTP for each session.
2.Email Functionality: Simulates sending the OTP to the user’s email address.
3.User Interaction: Prompts the user to enter the OTP they received.
4.Validation Process: Checks if the entered OTP matches the generated one.
5.Error Handling: User-friendly error messages and retry options for incorrect OTP entries.

## How It Works

The user enters their email address to receive the OTP.
The system generates a random 6-digit OTP.
The OTP is sent to the specified email address.
The user is prompted to enter the received OTP.
The system verifies the entered OTP against the generated one.
If the OTP matches, access is granted; otherwise, the user can try again.
