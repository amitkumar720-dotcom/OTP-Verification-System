 ## Problem Statement
In a world increasingly reliant on digital authentication, securing access to sensitive accounts is vital. Traditional methods can be easily compromised. The OTP Verification System provides an additional layer of security by ensuring that only users with access to their email can validate their identity, thus minimizing the risk of unauthorized access.

## Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Development Tools:
Jupyter Notebook for coding and documentation.
PowerPoint for project presentation.
Raw document format for supplementary documentation.

## Features

OTP Generation: Creates a unique 6-digit OTP for each session.
Email Functionality: Simulates sending the OTP to the user’s email address.
User Interaction: Prompts the user to enter the OTP they received.
Validation Process: Checks if the entered OTP matches the generated one.
Error Handling: User-friendly error messages and retry options for incorrect OTP entries.

6. Features
Highlight the key features of your project.

Example:

OTP Generation: Creates a unique 6-digit OTP for each session.
Email Functionality: Simulates sending the OTP to the user’s email address.
User Interaction: Prompts the user to enter the OTP they received.
Validation Process: Checks if the entered OTP matches the generated one.
Error Handling: User-friendly error messages and retry options for incorrect OTP entries.

## How It Works

The user enters their email address to receive the OTP.
The system generates a random 6-digit OTP.
The OTP is sent to the specified email address.
The user is prompted to enter the received OTP.
The system verifies the entered OTP against the generated one.
If the OTP matches, access is granted; otherwise, the user can try again.

## Installation
Provide clear steps for installation.

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
Clone the repository using:
git clone 
Navigate to the project directory:
cd otp-verification-system

## Usage
1.Open the Jupyter Notebook named otp_verification_system.ipynb.
2.Execute the code cells in the notebook to run the OTP verification system.
3.Follow the on-screen instructions to test the OTP functionality.
## Documentation
Comprehensive documentation is included in the Jupyter Notebook, detailing each function's purpose, how to run the program, and any required dependencies.

## Testing
The OTP Verification System has undergone thorough testing to ensure:

1.Successful OTP generation and email dispatch.
2.Correct handling of user input during the OTP verification process.
3.Appropriate responses to incorrect OTP entries, with options to retry.
